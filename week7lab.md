# Part 2
## Editing the file through VSCode and using scp took me 2 minutes and 37 seconds. I had prepared the command for scp and bash test so I did not run into any difficulties. Editing the file through vim took 5 minutes and 20 seconds. I also had the appropriate bash test command from one of the previous labs. The only difference between both options is that one uses vim, while the other simply edits through vs code and uses scp. I prefer using the vim option because it requires you to have less commands set up or memorized beforehand (no scp). However, if the code was more lengthy and required more edits, I would prefer editing through vs code since I would not have to navigate through the various vim commands.
